# Sentiment Analysis Tool

A simple Python-based Sentiment Analysis tool for analyzing social media posts using NLTK's VADER.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze the sentiment of text data (positive, negative, or neutral) using Python and NLTK. It includes:

- **Data processing scripts** for cleaning and preparing text.
- **Sentiment analysis script** using NLTK's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`.
- **Streamlit app** (`app.py`) for interactive analysis in the browser.

> **Note:** Large dataset files are excluded from this repository. You can use your own datasets to test the project.

## Features

- Analyze text for positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
- Interactive Streamlit UI for easy testing.
- Modular Python scripts for preprocessing and analysis.

This is **one block**, all code blocks remain intact, so you can copy it directly to `README.md` and the styling will remain consistent in GitHub.  

If you want, I can also **write a matching `.gitignore`** for your repo so nothing unwanted gets pushed. Do you want me to do that?
